# Tetris-Unity

An old project in 2018. The goal was to recreate Tetris for the Gameboy in Unity. The version of Tetris here was reverse-engineered from the Gameboy version. Observation was used to mimic the original assets and functionality as much as possible. Later, I also included keyboard and mouse UI navigation.

At the time, I did not do much project planning nor know about design patterns. The project stopped because there were changes to the code were affecting unexpected dependencies. While the more commonly known gamemode of Tetris, A-Type, was implemented, B-Type was not, precisely because of how the code was made.

Now, with more experience with Unity, I can see how the project can be made more reliable. However, it's more likely I would start fresh with a new codebase to reconstruct Tetris rather than attempt to fix this one.
